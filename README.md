This is the official GitHub account and associated repos of Lmaos, a group of fuckers doing absolute bullshit with tech.

We are based in Scandinavia.

There will never be illegalities here. We may or may not have privated repos with sketchy shit.

This is mainly for ease of use for team members, api calls/webhooks, or just generally useful stuff we've made.
